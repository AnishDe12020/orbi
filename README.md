# Orbi

A black and red [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) theme.

Orbi uses [Sequoia Moonlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wicked-labs.sequoia) (MIT licensed) as its base. I have changed some colors (notably background colors, accent colors and the ANSI terminal colors) to suite my taste.

Orbi uses ANSI terminal colors from [Ayu Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu) (MIT licensed) **as a base for the terminal colors**, and, as of v1.3, some of these colors have been updated.

I will be updating this themes in the due course of time to suite my taste. Till now, other than the initial color changes, the red accent color, string colors, variable/entity name colors and some of the ANSI terminal colors have been updated. For the time being, there is no fixed color palette.

## Contributing

Please open an issue for any suggestion/to discuss any change. The colors chosen are those which meet my taste and I may or may not accept any changes to the current color palette (of course, if I like any suggestion, I would be happy to implement it :) )
